I have a family chat where members often like to send voice messages. Often, I do not have the opportunity to listen to them, especially during work. I decided to make a bot to translate voice to text. 

Skills: python

- 🔭 what do i plan to add?
  -   Add function for set up language for users      
  -   Add OCR for image recognition 



**My bot:** [<img src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@3.0.1/icons/telegram.svg' alt='telegram' height='40'>](https://t.me/SpeechaBot)
